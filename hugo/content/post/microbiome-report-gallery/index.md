**curatedMetagenomicData (Waldron Lab)**

The source datasets used to generate the living figures
shown below were published as part of the
[curatedMetagenomicData project from the Waldron Lab](https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/).
For each dataset, a simple standardized analysis was performed
using a single metadata grouping from the associated metadata.
In many cases this approach will not fully capture the complexity
of the study which generated the inforation, but hopefully it
provides a starting point for understanding the distribution
of microbes across the dataset.

Clicking on any of the links below will open an interactive
collection of living figures showing the results of the
Microbiome Report for each dataset.
